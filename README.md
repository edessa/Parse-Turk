# Parse-Turk
amazon_reject_static.py takes in a CSV file, loads the images from their corresponding AWS Cloud storage file, and displays the polygon annotations. Hit 'a' to accept an annotation, and 'r' to reject an annotation. Final annotation results with acceptances/rejections are stored in the 'Annotations' folder called '50-Salads-Hand-Polygons-Checked.csv', which you upload to Amazon Turk's Annotation Manager tab.

Make sure to change the CSV filename to match what you download from the Mechanical Turk site.
